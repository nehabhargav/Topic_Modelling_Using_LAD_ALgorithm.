# Topic_Modelling_Using_LAD_ALgorithm.
This is a  Analysis project  which can be used for any Data Science project, here analysis is done on the twitter data . 
Here 3 to 4 weeks tweets were collected which was then stored in a readable CSV format.
The data csv file is uploaded .

Every analysis project first starts with a question.
We had the same questions in our mind , which were as follows 


How would world react to the Pandemic of 2020 also called as COVID 19 Pandemic ?
What would be the most discussed topics amoung people ?
Could there be any grouping in thoes topics ? 

The results of this analysis were amazing .And answered all out questions.

PS:

Before running the code make sure you have installed R Studio.
It requires an immense knowledge of R programming . So make sure you are aware of basics of R.
It also required basics of Machine Learning. 
Make sure to brush your basics.
Here we have also implemented LDA algorithm which is an NLP algorithm.
After applying all the algorithm . The results were then uploaded on a website which was made using shiny 
This is how our final analysis looks like.
